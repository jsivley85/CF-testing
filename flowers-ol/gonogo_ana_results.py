# commission errors (i.e., falsely pressing the button in no-go trials; also called false alarms)

#  Some studies have reported indices based on signal detection theory such as discrimination index d' or decision bias
#  C and it has been argued that C is a better indicator of disinhibition than commission errors alone as it takes the number
#  of both hits and false alarms into account (NoÃ«l et al., 2005; Mobbs et al., 2008).
