      <p>  
          <UL> 
          <li>The goal of this experiment is to measure the attention ability of multiple targets. </li> 
          <li>In each trial, you will see a brief presentation of a cross target with four stripe objects. </li>
          <li>You have to answer <b>two tasks </b>for each trial.</li> 
          <li>First, you have to answer <b>which of the lines are longer</b> using your keyboard.  </li>
          <UL>
          <li>If <b>the vertical line is longer</b>, then please press <b><kbd>"F"</kbd></b> key. </li>
          <li>If <b>the horizontal line is longer</b>, then please press <b><kbd>"J"</kbd></b> key. </li>
          </UL>
          <li>After this response, you have to answer <b>which of the four objects had the strong contrast stripe </b> by clicking one of four buttons. </li>
          <UL>
          <li> The "strong contrast" means that white and black colors are more differentiated.</li>
          </UL>
          <li>Please keep in mind that you have to answer at least the first question correctly. If not, your response for the second question will not be recorded.</li>
          <li>You can check the practice trials of this task from the following window.</li>
